    A way to achieve goals with 95% success‚Ä¶.. <br>
Starting with white paper research, began to draw from research articles on the topic of goals, motivation, <br>
 and achievement- upon an eye-opening statistic Training and Development: <br>

‚Äú..people are 65 percent likely to meet a goal after making their goal public. But their chances of success increase <br>
 to 95 percent when they have a specific accountability partner to report to‚Äù<br>
<h4>COMPETITIVE ANALYSIS + THE GAP</h4> <br>
The competition had NO ACCOUNTABILITY aspect. <br>
While keeping the above statistic in mind, I analyzed the 4 most popular apps surrounding this goal/productivity space. <br>
 I found that almost none of them had this aspect of an accountability partner to help the user achieve their goals. This <br>
  then became my opportunity for the solution. <br>
</b>

<h2>USER INTERVIEWS</h2> <br>
<p>My interviewees were 3x more likely to succeed when there was accountability for their goals. <br>
    Although I saw from research accountability was important, I‚Äôve conducted interviews with 8 students who failed <br>
     at achieving their personal goals. I‚Äôve asked them questions below to find trends on why they failed at some goals <br>
      versus others then organized my data through affinity mapping. </p> <br>

<h3>RESEARCH QUESTIONS:
</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Tell me about the last goal you set?</li>
    <li>What was the most difficult part about trying to achieve your goal? Why?</li>
    <li> What motivated you to start in the first place?</li>
    <li>What was your process for trying to achieve that goal?</li>
    <li> Tell me about a time you had to do something difficult and accomplished it.</li>
</ul>
